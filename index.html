            Hello all, and welcome to my personal website. My name is Joel 
            Liesenberg, and I am currently a second year dual-degree graduate student at the 
            University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am pursuing degrees in both International
            and Regional Studies, focusing in Japanese Studies, and Information Science,
            focusing in Digital Curation. I was born and raised here in Michigan, spending a majority
            of my life up north in East Jordan. After graduating from Central Michigan University in
            2018 with a BA in English (focusing in English as a Second Language and
            Creative Writing), I had the opportunity to live and teach just outside of Tokyo, Japan
            for two years. And now, at the University of Michigan, I hope to combine my love of
            the humanities and Japan into a future career working in the digital humanities with Japanese
            materials.

            This website houses several pages. The first is a breakdown of several of my previous projects
            that I have completed as part of my graduate journey, spanning several classes and topics.
            The next is a look at some personal Japanese translation projects I've started dabbling with
            in my free time. And as of now, the final page is a gallery collections of images from my time
            living in Japan. More will hopefully be added as more projects/trips/translations are undertaken
            in the future. My contact information has been added at the bottom of the site, and please feel
            free to get in touch with me at any time.
