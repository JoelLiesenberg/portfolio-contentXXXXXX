            One of the first essays I wrote was an analysis of Mishima Yukio's
            classic novel 'Confessions of a Mask,' which is widely regarded as
            a fictional autobiography, and deals with several themes, such as homosexuality,
            personal versus national identity, and the ideal of beauty. My essay
            specifically looks at the use of external works/people as figurative language 
            within the work. The most noteworthy example of this is Mishima's invocation of
            St. Sebastian and the paintings of his execution.

            Another piece I wrote was a research paper looking at the rates of internal
            migration within the ten largest cities in Japan. Based on the maps I created
            using data from the Japanese government, I spend the rest of the paper conducting
            a case study comparison of Sapporo and Fukuoka, two similarly sized cities with 
            very different trends in terms of their internal migration, specifically looking
            at the internal migration of foreign residents, not native Japanese citizens. I
            look at things such as government internationalization documents, web pages and
            the languages supported, and resources present for foreign residents within those cities.

            Probably my most involved project thus far within my graduate career is a multimedia
            analysis of the Japanese role-playing-game "NieR: Automata" by way of Foucault's theory
            of biopower. Automata's plot is a postapocalyptic story of two proxy armies (Androids and Machines),
            fighting an endless war on behalf of their creators (humans and aliens, respectively). Both are
            fundamentally opposed, but each is trying to prove themselves as the most 'alive' and/or 
            'human'. It is a narrative examining humanity by decentering and fully removing humans. I
            look at the text in translation (English localization), the music, visual storytelling, gameplay,
            etc. This is also hosted on a website insted of written traditionally in order to accomodate
            these non-textual elements.
