            One of the classic ways to practice Japanese translation is by looking at
            one of your favorite pieces of Japanese media in the original Japanese. While
            I was living in Japan I purchased a complete copy of the manga 'Azumanga Daioh'
            which is a manga I read a lot as a child in the translated English. It's a basic
            manga about a group of girls in high school and is written in a comic-strip format,
            with each strip comprising of about four panels. In my free time as I gain
            confidene in my Japanese ability, I work with the Japanese version of this manga
            and practice translating.

            'Danganronpa' is a series of Japanese video games that deal with a group of
            high school students who are forced into a killing-game where in order to
            escape, they have to kill one of their classmates and get away with it. The games
            are presented in a decidedly trope-y anime style, but frequently deal with complex
            and surprisingly dark and serious themes. This year I hope to use some translations
            of these games to examine gender/sexuality as depicted in contemporary Japanese
            media.

            In the future, as a person with a long history with classic English literature and
            fantasy, a goal of mine is to work with the Japanese translation of Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings,'
            which is one of my favorite series. With my current level of Japanese, this kind of reverse
            translation probably isn't very feasible, but I like to tinker and experiment, so I thought
            it would be a worthwhile addition to this website as something I am aiming for in the future.
